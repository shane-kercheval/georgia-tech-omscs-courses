      "Applications and services are supported by software platforms such as operating systems and databases. Secure execution of such applications depends on the trust assumptions that can be made about these systems. By providing right mechanisms for protecting sensitive information and other resources, operating systems and databases can facilitate the development of secure applications. A uniform approach for exploring security support in operating systems and databases is attractive because both types of systems must offer similar mechanisms to mediate access to protected information. This course will take such an approach and it will explore problems such as authentication and access control that are traditionally handled at the system level. Students will also gain in depth understanding of the implementations of mechanisms that address these problems and security policies that can be supported by them. System level security issues in distributed systems will be covered as well.\n",

      "OVERVIEW:\n",
      "In the 21st century, embedded systems are the systems of future with cellular phones, smart-phones, and tablets becoming the dominant platforms for computing and communication. The ubiquity of information and the associated need for the computation that accompanies it is driving this revolution only to be accelerated by the new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These platforms are clearly very different in terms of their processing requirements which are very unique: real-time needs, high performance but at low energy, compact-code and data segments, and most importantly ever-changing software stack. Such unique requirements have led to a complete redesign and reinvention of both hardware and the software stack from the ground up. For example, brand new processors such as ARM, DSPs, and network processors were invented, in addition to new virtual machines such as Dalvik, new operating systems such as Android, and new programming models and compiler optimizations. The goal of this course is to take a holistic view of the embedded system stack with a focus on processor architectures, instruction sets, and the associated advanced compiler optimizations that take advantage of the same. Following are the segments that will be covered in the course:\n",

How do strongly-typed programming languages prevent bugs in your code? How can we be ahead of our users in finding bugs in complicated systems that may not have been caught by our testing efforts? In this class, we will explore these topics along with several others that together make up the field of software analysis.\n",
      "The point of software analysis is to determine whether software is correct. Today, the cost of software development is less than 50% programming, with testing, debugging, security assessments, and similar tasks taking more resources than developing the software itself. As a result, there is an increasing focus in the software industry on using tools to write better software. These tools can take the form of testing tools that help find bugs but they can also take the form of analysis techniques that have the goal of building a stronger code foundation with fewer areas where defects can emerge, the end result being less risk in the software development lifecycle. \n",
      "In this class, we will investigate multiple techniques for analyzing software and the limits of what software analysis can tell us. Each lesson covers a different area of software analysis and many lessons have a corresponding lab where you will gain hands-on experience with the technique covered in the lecture. The labs will evaluate your practical use of the techniques, while the exams will evaluate your understanding of the lessons not covered by labs and also the theories of software analysis techniques.\n",
      "Applications of techniques covered in this class relate to performance, cyber security, testing, and debugging. In this course, you will study the underlying principles of software analysis and these approaches, and gain hands-on experience applying them to automate testing software and finding bugs in complex, real-world programs. You will explore techniques including dataflow analysis, constraint-based analysis, type systems, automated test case generation, symbolic execution, and more. \n",
      "While testing is frequently part of software analysis, the approach to software testing presented in this class is directly tied to analysis and is frequently different than the testing usually performed as part of quality assurance in a typical software development lifecycle.\n",

      "Abuse of big data means your worst fears can come true. Being monitored by your employer? Check. Government intrusions into your daily life? Check. Being turned down by college admissions because you are predicted to not donate in 10-20 years? Check. Sounds a bit like the visions in the Minority Report? Alas, machine learning algorithms are already being deployed by industry, government, and yes, even schools to make decisions that impact us in direct ways. Such programs are typically promoted as fair and free of human biases; but humans, humans that make mistakes, are programming, calibrating, and evaluating their performance. Thus resides the problem. How do we therefore design algorithms that effectively deal with the large amounts of data that are used to train them, while ensuring their outcomes aren't, well, misused. In this course, not only will we examine various AI/ML techniques that can be used to counterbalance the potential abuse and misuse of learning from big data, but we will focus on the effects of these technologies on individuals, organizations, and society, paying close attention to what our responsibilities are as computing professionals.\n",

      "OVERVIEW:\n",
      "Welcome to CS 7632 Game AI.\n",
      "As applied to video game development, Artificial Intelligence serves a different purpose than general AI research. This is due to the fact that general AI is often concerned with finding a correct and/or optimal answer. However, the goal of Game AI is to simply provide a fun gameplay experience. Because of this, Game AI solutions may involve cutting corners, tricking the game player, or otherwise cheating in regard to implementation. Game AI also faces the challenge of limited computational resources as video games involve a lot of subsystems that must work in coordination such as graphics, sound, physics simulation, etc. Game AI is often a lower priority in this list of game features and further motivates the corner cutting strategies.\n",
      "While Game AI generally leverages concepts from classic AI research, you will see that there are many unique implementation strategies for achieving a fun game play experience. The Game AI course covers topics including agent movement, path planning, decision making, goal-oriented behavior, learning, and procedural content generation.\n",

      "OVERVIEW:\n",
      "Cyber-physical systems are systems comprising both a physical part and a software part, whereby the physical part of the system sends information about itself to the software part, and the software sends information, usually in the form of commands, to the physical part. The development of cyber-physical systems, therefore, requires knowing a mix of competencies relative to physical systems, on the one hand, and software systems, on the other hand. Because physical systems have \"a life of their own\", and they can often harm operators (think airplanes, medical devices, or cars) and/or cost a fortune to repair (think power grid and centrifuges), the development of programs that control these systems cannot rely much on \"trial and error\". This course introduces the tools and models that will allow attendees to develop high confidence in the resulting system's proper operation prior to any operational test. Included are tools for model-based systems engineering, and cyber-physical system verification and validation currently in use by the CPS industry. Numerous examples will be considered, from aerospace, automotive, medical devices, etc. The frequent presence of human operators is also acknowledged and discussed in-depth. Various verification and validation formalisms (formal methods) are described and applied to simple examples.\n",

      "This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. “Scale” really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so. The techniques you’ll encounter cover the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice.

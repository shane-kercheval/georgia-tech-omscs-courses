### Recommendation 1: Specialization in Machine Learning

Given your strong background in data science, machine learning (ML), and software development, along with your interest in programming-driven projects rather than purely mathematical or theoretical explorations, the Machine Learning specialization is a perfect match for you. It leverages your considerable experience while pushing you into new areas of ML that might interest you. 

**Core/Required Courses:**

1. **CS 7641 Machine Learning** - As the cornerstone of this specialization, this course aligns with your existing strengths in ML and software development. It will deepen your theoretical understanding and practical skills in ML. Brush up on Python, as it's commonly used here.
   
2. **CS 6505 Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity** or **CS 6515 Introduction to Graduate Algorithms** - Given your software development background, CS 6515 would reinforce your algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills critical in ML. Review algorithm design and complexity analysis to prepare.

**Elective Courses:**

3. **CS 7643 Deep Learning** - This is a natural extension of your interest in advanced AI products and tools. As youâ€™ve worked with LLMs, deep learning principles can enhance your expertise in neural networks and their applications. Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of deep learning before starting.
   
4. **CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading** - This course would not only leverage your data analysis skills but also introduce you to the financial applications of ML, a new domain that can broaden your impact as an ML engineer. Brush up on financial terminology and basic trading principles.

5. **CS 7626 Behavioral Imaging** - This course aligns with your interest in applying ML to solve complex problems. It ventures into analyzing human behavior through data, which might offer you new perspectives on deploying AI solutions in human-centric applications.

6. **CS 6476 Computer Vision** - Given your ML background, diving deeper into how computers interpret visual data could be both a challenge and an expansion of your skill set, particularly for AI-driven products. Review linear algebra and basic image processing concepts.

7. **CSE 6240 Web Search and Text Mining** - It complements your experience with semantic search and recommendation systems, focusing on handling and extracting information from textual data. Brush up on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and information retrieval principles.

For the remaining courses, considering your broad interests and the need to fill in some gaps, the following would be beneficial:

8. **CS 6440 Introduction to Health Informatics** - Expands your impact by applying ML and data analysis skills in healthcare, a sector that increasingly relies on data-driven decisions.

9. **CS 6250 Computer Networks** - Offers a foundation in the technical infrastructure that underlies the deployment of ML models, important for understanding how your AI solutions can be scaled and distributed.

10. **CS 6200 Introduction to Operating Systems** - Understanding the software platform your AI solutions run on can greatly enhance performance optimization and troubleshooting skills.

### Recommendation 2: Specialization in Interactive Intelligence

Considering your stated interest in programming and software development over a purely mathematical approach to ML, and noticing a desire to branch out, the Interactive Intelligence specialization could address your knowledge gaps, particularly in human-computer interaction (HCI), ethics, and advanced AI applications.

**Core/Required Courses:**

1. **CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence** - Serves as an introduction to broader AI concepts beyond ML, rounding out your technical expertise. Prepare by reviewing AI fundamentals and Python programming.

2. **CS 6750 Human-Computer Interaction** - Directly addresses your lack of experience in HCI, an area vital for designing user-centric AI solutions. Familiarize yourself with basic design principles and user experience (UX) research methodologies.

3. **CS 7637 Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence - Cognitive Systems** - Offers a bridge between AI and human-like reasoning, enhancing your ability to work on projects at the intersection of AI and human intelligence.

**Elective Courses:**

4. **CS 6603 AI, Ethics, and Society** - Fills a crucial knowledge gap in the ethical considerations necessary for responsible AI deployment. Understanding the societal impact of AI technologies is increasingly important.

5. **CS 6460 Educational Technology: Conceptual Foundations** - Expands your view on how AI and ML can transform education, a new application area for your skills.

6. **CS 7643 Deep Learning** - Recommended again here for its depth and because your work with LLMs suggests an affinity for this area of ML.

7. **CS 6476 Computer Vision** - Continues to be relevant for its computational approach to interpreting visual data, broadening your application of ML.

Remaining courses to enhance your knowledge in new but related areas:

8. **CS 6456 Principles of User Interface Software** - Delves into software considerations for HCI, enhancing your ability to develop user-friendly AI products.

9. **CSE 6242 Data and Visual Analytics** - Provides you with tools and techniques to visually interpret complex datasets, a valuable skill for any data scientist and ML engineer.

10. **CS 6465 Computational Journalism** - As a niche but emerging field, it offers a unique perspective on how AI can support automated news writing and analysis, expanding the reach of your ML expertise to new industries.

These recommendations aim to leverage your strengths and interests while strategically filling in your knowledge gaps, positioning you for advancement in your career.

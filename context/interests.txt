- The types of projects I'm interested in lie at the intersection of programming, machine learning, and solving business problems with a direct impact.
- There are various types of data scientists. Some have strong math backgrounds (e.g., PhD), while others come from a software engineering background. I possess a background in math from my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Calculus 1, 2, 3; Physics 1, 2, 3; Linear Algebra, etc.). However, it has been many years since I've taken a math course and my skillset and interests lean more towards programming and software development than mathematics. However, I would be open to math-heavy courses if they are directly applicable to the work I'm doing. 
- I have been a data scientist for approximately eight years. However, the most intriguing projects for me are engineering and software-driven rather than mathematics-focused.
- Recently, my title has changed from Senior Data Scientist to Senior Machine Learning Engineer, which I believe better aligns with my strengths and interests.
